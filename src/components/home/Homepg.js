The techniques used in these methods  are very simple yet their power is amazing. These methods for fast calculation are available for a wide range of  operations from basic multiplication to solving simultaneous equations.
                There are certain salient features about these methods that make them so powerful.</p>

                    The shortcuts used are well suited for mental calculations. At any stage of calculation, it is enough to remember just a few (maximum 3) digits and therefore, it becomes easy for us to work them out mentally.

                    <li className="home-li">
                    These techniques make use of the place value system of  numbers and hence are independent of the base used.
